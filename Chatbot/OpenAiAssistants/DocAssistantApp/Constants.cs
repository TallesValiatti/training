        ## Responsible AI
        Microsoft is committed to advancing AI based on principles that put people first. Responsible use of AI on Azure includes:
        - Content filters to prevent abuse.
        - Responsible AI guidelines.
        - Service code of conduct.
        
        ---
        
        ## Introduction to Azure OpenAI Service
        Azure OpenAI Service provides access to the REST API and SDKs for OpenAI's advanced language models, such as:
        - GPT-4o
        - GPT-4 Turbo with Vision
        - GPT-3.5-Turbo
        - Embedding Models
        
        ### Features:
        - **Fine-tuning:** Available for models like GPT-4o-mini and GPT-3.5-Turbo.
        - **Virtual network and private link:** Supported.
        - **User interface:** Available via Azure Portal and Azure AI Studio.
        
        #### How to get started:
        1. **Create a resource:** Use the Azure portal, CLI, or PowerShell.
        2. **Deploy a model:** Choose a model to use in the API.
        3. **Explore features:** Try the AI Studio playgrounds or call APIs.
        
        ---
        
        ## Compare Azure OpenAI and OpenAI
        Azure OpenAI combines OpenAI’s advanced models with:
        - Azure security.
        - Private network support.
        - Regional availability.
        - Responsible AI content filtering.
        
        Customers can use the same API on both platforms, ensuring compatibility.
        
        ---
        
        ## Key Concepts
        ### Requests and Completions
        - **Endpoint:** Provides an interface for model input/output.
        - **Example:**
          - **Prompt:** `count to 5 in a for loop`
          - **Completion:** `for i in range(1, 6): print(i)`
        
        ### Tokens
        - **Text:** Split into smaller parts. E.g., "hamburger" = "ham", "bur", "ger."
        - **Image:** Calculated based on details and dimensions.
        
        #### Example of token calculation:
        - **Highly detailed image:**
          - **Model:** GPT-4 Turbo with Vision.
          - **Initial dimension:** 2048x4096 pixels.
          - **Calculation:** 6 pieces x 170 tokens + 85 base tokens = **1,105 tokens**.
        
        ---
        
        ## Prompt Engineering
        GPT models are prompt-based, and prompt design directly influences the model's response.
        
        ### Tips:
        - Test and refine prompts for better results.
        - Consider the model's sensitivity to context.
        
        ---
        
        ## Available Models
        ### Text
        - GPT-3, GPT-3.5, GPT-4 (versions with fine-tuning available).
        
        ### Image
        - DALL-E Models: Generate images from text.
        
        ### Speech
        - Whisper: Transcribe and translate speech to text.
        - Text-to-Speech: Convert text to audio.
